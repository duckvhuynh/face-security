# 🔒 Face Security System - Project Complete!

## 🎉 Successfully Created

I have successfully created a comprehensive Python facial recognition security system that meets all your requirements:

### ✅ Core Features Implemented

1. **👤 Facial Recognition Security**
   - Uses MediaPipe for fast, accurate face detection
   - Registers owner's face with multiple samples for reliability
   - Real-time comparison of detected faces vs. registered owner

2. **🔐 Password Protection**
   - Secure password setup during registration
   - Encrypted storage of face data and password hash
   - Dual authentication: face recognition + password unlock

3. **🖥️ Screen Blurring Protection**
   - Automatically blurs screen when unauthorized person detected
   - Fullscreen overlay with security warning
   - Grace period (3 seconds) before activation

4. **⌨️ Emergency Unlock**
   - Hotkey system (Ctrl+Alt+O) for manual unlock
   - Password verification for secure access
   - Automatic unlock when owner returns
